To write a script in R that utilizes and demonstrates the statistical concepts of Kurtosis, Cross Tabulation, Covariance, Continous/Quantitative Variables, Multivariate, Categorical, and Variation. 


As a Technology Teacher I need to produce statistical summaries that explain how variables in my data set relate to each other so that I can develop hypotheses to guide my analysis.  I hope to be able to use these concepts as I move further along in this program and also outside of this program after completion.


Set the proper working directory in R, read in the Zillow_Median_Sales_Price_Per_County, performed exploratory analysis, wrote the script to calculate the various statistical concepts mentioned above.

Things I learned:
